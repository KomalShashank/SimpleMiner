Deep Learning,

I was really excited to find out that we would be doing 3D games this mod but I was also a little tensed about time management because we would be developing our TGP 1 projects in this mod. I expected the TGP development to overwhelm my SD assignments with regards to having time to finish them but after seeing how well structured the TGP development process is and how the timings are kept separate from our regular classes, I was very much relieved.

In regards to my programming skills, it didn't become apparent right away but when I did a two minute reflection and introspected myself, I felt so happy to find that I have learned so much in the 10 weeks I was here. I don't know if other programmers have experienced this but I started at a point where every letter I typed had a sort of hesitation to them, as if I kept saying to myself, "Am I doing this right?". It is hard to describe that feeling but essentially, it was kind of like an inexperienced novice hesitation. But now, after 10 weeks, I have earned a level of confidence that I no longer have that feeling. My hands move across the keyboard a lot more confidently now. And this confidence that I gained is not something that is just built over time. I actually gained a lot of knowledge over the days and that is what is responsible for me building up this level of confidence. And I am really happy that I improved so much.

For this Simple Miner game, I was a lot more confident with my programming and managed my time really well. Maybe the scope of this assignment is small or maybe my perception of the scope of the assignment changed because I was a lot more confident, but ultimately I finished one day before the submission date, an improvement from the finishing on the day of submission. In conclusion, I would say I'm very satisfied with myself so far and I look forward to my future endeavors.


ASSIGNMENT II:


Known Issues,

I have not implemented raycasting yet, so block placing and deletion is not available in this version of the game. Flushing remaining active chunks on exit has also not been implemented. Everything else required for this assignment apart from the above two things have been implemented correctly with no bugs.

Deep Learning,

Okay. I have to say this. I was very confident about last milestone because it was scoped small. But for this milestone, not so much. However, I must say I did not lose my determination. I was not able to complete all the requirements on time because there was so much to do and also there was a lot of other priorities I had to balance. But, that's the reality of working in this industry or any other related industry. Not everything can be accomplished in time and I have to make my peace with that. I can't keep worrying myself over it and stop myself from moving forward in life. That is a very important lesson that I learned since I came here. And it is important because I am a perfectionist and I have trouble giving up on something if it doesn't end up perfect. I have lost sleep over it in many situations. However, I am really glad that I learned such an important lesson and more importantly, I am really very happy that I am learning new stuff related to my specialization everyday.

YES! I DID IT! Lighting in four hours. There were so many other responsibilities that I had to catch up on and balance that throughout the majority of the assignment duration, I had time only to fix and catch up on incomplete features from my previous assignment. By the time I got to the lighting part, which is a major part of the assignment, it was the day of the deadline. And that too, it was an extra day grace period. My apologies for this long story, but it needs to be told. I still hadn't started the lighting part completely by the time I reached Professor Eiserloh's office for office hours consultation. By the time office hours were done, I was only finishing the early stages of the lighting algorithm. Professor Eiserloh was a little surprised to hear I haven't done the major part of the algorithm yet. He advised me to finish on time and also cautioned me that I only had a few hours left and any unexpected bugs would be disadvantageous to me.
However, I took it as a challenge, partly because my options were limited and partly because I was determined to finish this assignment, unlike the previous one which was not fully complete. By the time the office time was closing in, I finished the algorithm but I had hit a few unexpected bugs (as expected, ironically). I was a little disappointed and by the end of the day, I was on the verge of giving up when I asked Regan to help me debug my code. A different perspective always helps and sure enough, the bugs were caused by a single line of code in a function that I had debugged through and missed several times but Regan found in a single step through. Some people are egotistical about their code, but it always helps to have your peers, friends, colleagues, etc. help debug your code. You will get the chance of seeing your code with eyes that are not your own. If only more programmers would realize this.
Also, I have to say that I observed a lot of the students in my class don't make use of many of the suggestions that Professor Eiserloh gives us. I understand that it's a suggestion and it's your choice to implement that suggestion or not, but the suggestion is given for a reason. I have seen a lot of my classmates have not implemented some things in their game that would've made their work a lot easier. An example would be the BlockDefinitions and BlockInfo classes. They are very helpful (Thank you, Professor!) and make the job so much easier. I have observed them struggling to implement a solution which can be easily done with these helper classes. I also noticed that the Professor reiterated in later assignments about implementing these classes so as to emphasize their usefulness. So far, it has been smooth sailing for me (with a few hiccups) because I am closely following the Professor's advice and suggestions and I will continue to do so. I am really happy that I improved so much and I am really looking forward to the next assignment because it is my favourite branch of programming - Physics.


ASSIGNMENT IV:


Known Issues,

I haven't implemented Jump since I was having problems with adding the impulse. Also, there are some minor problems with the physics where I am snagging on corners. I still have to fix that.

Deep Learning,

Well, I said physics was my favourite but I didn't say it was my strongest suit. True enough, I did have troubles. When Professor Eiserloh explained it in the class, it seemed so easy. I thought, and so did most of my friends, "Piece of cake. We did this for Assault." And it IS easy. In fact, Professor Eiserloh did not do much calculation on the board because there was nothing new or complex. It was the same basic stuff. Then, why did it feel hard and frustrating? Because, it is physics. There are so many minute and tiny edge cases that we had to keep in mind that it drove us all nuts. Keeping in touch with each other and helping each other out really helps us finish the task, because there are some things some people consider that others don't until they are told about them. Nevertheless, I think I, along with my friends, managed to complete it. We all did well in the end.


ASSIGNMENT V:


Known Issues,

Jump is still not implemented due to some problems with physics. That will be resolved in the next milestone. Walking sounds have not been added because of some problems with the step calculation. Block breaking animation also hasn't been implemented yet.

Soundtrack added - The game randomly shuffles and plays eight adventure music tracks during playthrough.
Entity class and enemies - Enemy and entity classes have been added in the game with the player and enemy classes abstracted to derive from the entity class.


Deep Learning,

For this milestone, I got the chance to implement the feature I've been waiting for the most: Split Screen. I was really intrigued about the idea and was very eager to implement it. But, it had to wait. Because, I had a lot of pending stuff from previous assignments and that was first priority. So, I did the most logical thing I thought of: I made a scrum board. I really like the scrum process and I wondered how it would be to implement for personal assignments. Having said that, I have to say that it helped me so much in this milestone, because I got so many minor pending things done that I would've overlooked over the bigger stuff. It is a super helpful process.


ASSIGNMENT VI:


Known Issues,

There are no known major issues. The game may very very very very very VERY RARELY hang due to physics breaking because of floating point errors. But this is really rare. Other than that, there are no other issues.


How To Use,

Built in Release mode. To play the game, run SimpleMiner.exe located inside the Run_Win32 folder in the project folder. To open the Visual Studio solution and compile the executable, open the SimpleMiner.sln solution located in the project folder.

Controls:
Keyboard and mouse support has been removed in favour of implementing a multiplayer mode. Even though there is only one player playing in single player mode, the game only supports the use of the XBOX controller in order to keep the game's controls consistent. The only currently existing keyboard control is,

I - Toggle Debug Mode. Debug Mode displays the origin lines, on-screen player debug stats and an extra Fixed Angle Tracking (FAT) camera mode that shows how chunk frustum culling is performed. These do not exist naturally in normal gameplay until triggered by this keyboard key.

XBOX Controller:
D-PAD Up/D-PAD Down - Highlight options in Main Menu.
Left Stick - Move Player in the trigger's pushed direction.
Right Stick - Rotate the camera to look around in the trigger's pushed direction.
D-PAD Left/D-PAD Right - Change the selected block in the desired direction.
A-Button - Jump/Ascend in Fly Mode (Select highlighted option in Main Menu).
B-Button - Descend in Fly Mode (Return to previous screen in Main Menu).
X-Button - Resurrect Player on death.
Y-Button - Change camera mode (also includes FAT camera mode in Debug mode).
Left Bumper - Dig Highlighted Block.
Right Bumper - Place Block in Highlighted Space.
Left Trigger - Sprint while moving.
Right Trigger - Shoot bullets at enemies.
Start Button && Back Button (Together) - Exit to Main Menu (Both players have to press this at the same time to exit in two player mode).

Extra Cheat:
D-PAD Down && Right Stick Button (Together) - Toggle physics mode between walking, flying and no-clip mode (not intended as a gameplay feature, only a developer cheat).


Deep Learning,

WOW! Just... WOW! I really have to make sure I am not dreaming right now. If I am, please don't wake me up. Three and a half months ago... THREE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO! I couldn't even finish Asteroids. It's true. I never finished Asteroids. I think I got a B or B- or something. I don't remember. But who cares? I improved so much over these past three and a half months. More than I ever did in the past three years of my programming experience. And it's beautiful. I actually have a decent finished product that I can put on my portfolio and proudly say that I made in 8 weeks. I can't describe it in words right now, but the emotional feeling of having been gone from not finishing Asteroids and making a fully functional Minecraft clone with bonus features is inexpressable. But before I keep ranting on about how I feel, I just want to say I'm really really happy and proud that my game works and I have got badass level of physics, fully functional two player mode, perfect lighting, enemies and combat, epic background music, and all the different types of programming optimizations. It's amazing and I'm having a hard time believing it. Before I finish, I just want to say... Thank you very much, Professor Eiserloh. You really helped me grow as a programmer over these two mods and I'm sure all the other programmers in our class agree with me when I say we are all a little disappointed that you will not be teaching us for all our SD courses. Thank you.
